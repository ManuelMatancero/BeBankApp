# Installation 
In order to install the app you have to have an android emulator in the same computer you run the API, instead of use localhost(http://localhost:80/) you have to use the ip of your ethernet port(http://198.123.12.1:80/) to be added in a form that is gonna be shown in the login part once the app is opened and you try to log in.

# Note 
In order to run the app in the emulator you have to set up an emulator that supports a min SDK 26, which mean an android versions 8.0 and higher
